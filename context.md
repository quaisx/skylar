    - Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify the entities mentioned in each sentence or paragraph.
    - Use a part-of-speech (POS) tagger to identify the parts of speech in each sentence or paragraph.
    - Use a dependency parser to analyze the grammatical structure of each sentence or paragraph.
    - Use a semantic role labeler (SRL) to identify the roles played by entities in each sentence or paragraph.
